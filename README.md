# odin-recipes
This project involves creating a recipe website called "Odin Recipes" with multiple recipe pages. 
By completing this project, I have demonstrated skills in HTML, including structuring web pages, creating links, incorporating images, and organizing content. 
This project serves as a practical introduction to web development and provides a foundation for further exploration in this area.
